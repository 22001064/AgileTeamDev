The design is tested on multiple devices to ensure minimal scrolling.

## WIREFRAMES

The wireframes were designed in mind with the requests of the client which included using a static image in the home page for example, and keeping the overall design of the pages simple and clean as to not distract from the main goal of the app which is to ensure better task management. As can be seen on the wireframe there are different versions to show the progress made according to the clients requests.









## MOOD BOARD
